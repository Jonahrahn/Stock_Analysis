# Stock_Analysis

## Overview of Project:
This Stock Analysis Project is used to demonstrate multiple Macro Functions in Visual Basic to loop through a set of 12 green stock tickers data from 2017-2018 to return the return percentage and the Total Volume. In this project, I use macros to interpret the data in the first two worksheets. In the Macro portion of the profect I demonstrate well nested loops to return and calculate the total volume, starting prices, ending prices, and overall return. I have also refactored the project to add two sweet buttons, formatting and color to add a little bit of flair.

### Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to build an analysis of stock data in two seperate worksheets to compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018. I also wanted to make it easier to refactor the code to provide more applications in the future on different datasets. The purpose was to build a nice framework to expand the idea upon and analyse more recent and expansive data. With most of the steps set up with loops it will be easier to buid up the analysis over time.

## Results:
The execution times of the best script was 1.035 seconds for 2017 and 0.997 seconds for 2018. The results show that 2017 was a big year for msot green stocks as all but one wer in the green, but 2018 swings right back and knocks most stocks down with more volume than the year before.

In 2017, of all the stocks SEDG had the highest volume while RUN and CSIQ both had 180+%.

In 2018, of all the stocks ENPH had the highest volume while JKS and DQ both had 80+%. 

## Summary: 
Some advantages of using Visual Basic was that it was fairly easy to use and it felt like it unlocks more neccesary improvements to the features of excel. While refractoring my code, I was having a problem with the debug interface that wasnt helpful in what was messed up in the coding process. While trying to make the program more efficient and lean it was hard to know if there was anything I could compress. Some Pros to refactoring the code was that i could return the results faster and was easier to debug. Some cons were that I was mixing up variable names from the first script. Its always a missed 's' or something simple.
